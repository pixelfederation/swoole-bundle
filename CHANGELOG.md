* **coroutines:** added custom proxy type instead of lazy loading value holder to get rid of shared lazy tmp object access ([df3da24](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/df3da242b1da8cbeb6cd866fb3782c089e06e4ca))
* **coroutines:** added entity manager resetter, which is decoupled from the stability checker, so it can be overridden easily ([e8f5c7b](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/e8f5c7b1316d00421a822895450cc2aedeea17bd))

* **coroutines:** one time initialised lazy proxies will be always returned on context switch, even when the initialisation did not finish ([2a30be7](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/2a30be731a35301d13c2953e4a6deccc3cddbffb))

* **php-cs-fixer:** returned back the blank_line_between_import_groups rule ([b2c6480](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/b2c64804c2242c287b77107e3c8738edc12d49ac))

* **phpstan:** removed phpstan ignore annotation in CallableBootManagerFactory because of phpstan update ([db4b619](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/db4b61929bb3503e8ace6f0b8efbca91b92e635c))
* **proxies:** removed SF proxy factory because it is deleted in SF 6.2 ([22e2e9c](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/22e2e9c822a700fb27bb62d31a71cf8f133345a8))
* **proxifier:** coroutine proxifier - proxified services' service pools are shared or non-shared based on the proxified service shared flag, together with the service proxy ([c4c6006](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/c4c6006ff6d6fa7571061911a15d38d26e8b65d3))
* **shutdown:** default SF signal handlers were overriden so no exit is called on app shutdown ([30a71f8](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/30a71f886dcf90e61ab3c23e50db2f4d78803ab5))

* **swhutdown:** last shutdown fix should only work on pcntl enabled setups ([9cd2417](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/9cd2417b9307ea886146a06291ad6b242a4f0008))
* **tests:** fix for coverage tests - higher waiting values needed in some specific cases ([b10bd60](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/b10bd6075f0bfce863be8fb7ea23f941d5e779aa))

* **tests:** server tests need to clean up var folder on start and need to stop with same env variables ([46e2ae7](https://github.com/pixelfederation/swoole-bundle/commit/46e2ae7d55a1124ae21bb075b88941491bd5530d))
